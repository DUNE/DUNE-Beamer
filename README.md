# DUNE-Beamer

LaTeX Beamer Template for DUNE Slides

## Dependencies

Most modern LaTeX distributions should be able to build this just fine.
If on Ubuntu/Debian/Mint/etc. make sure you have texlive-xetex installed, as this will pull in all the required LaTeX packages.
```sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex```

## Building

Currently builds with `xelatex` or `pdflatex`, run `xelatex main.tex`/`pdflatex main.tex` to compile, then view `main.pdf` with your favourite PDF viewer.


## Editing

`main.pdf` contains some TODO notes, these indicate areas where changes _should_ be made, e.g. title, presenter name, university/institute logos, etc.

## Issues

This is a barebones working example to reproduce the standard DUNE slides with Beamer, if you have any issues using this, feel free to reach out to liam.osullivan@uni-mainz.de or @Liam on the DUNE slack. Issues can also be submitted on GitHub as usual, and Pull Requests for imrprovements are always welcome.
