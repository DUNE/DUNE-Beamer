# DUNE-Beamer

LaTeX Beamer Template for DUNE Slides

## Building

Currently builds only with `xelatex`, run `xelatex main.tex` to compile, then view `main.pdf` with your favourite PDF viewer.


## Editing

`main.pdf` contains some TODO notes, these indicate areas where changes _should_ be made, e.g. title, presenter name, university/institute logos, etc.
